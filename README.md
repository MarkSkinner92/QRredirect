## Example
This link will take you to amazon.ca: [markskinner92.github.io/QRredirect/?id=1](markskinner92.github.io/QRredirect/?id=1)

## Instructions
1. Clone this project to your own github account
2. Host it on github pages

## How to add your own URLs
Edit your index.html like this:

{
  0: "default/fallback URL", <- if there's a wierd ID or no id
  
  ID : "URL",
  ID : "URL",
  ID : "URL",
  ...
}

Commit your changes, give it a few minutes, and go to this URL (after replacing yourusername and yourid):
yourusername.github.io/QRredirect/?id=yourid

This will instantly take you to the corisponding URL

# Make that URL into a QR code
I reccomend using this site:
https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/
paste in the link you made and there you go!
