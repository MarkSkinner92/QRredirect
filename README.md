## Instructions
1. Clone this project to your own github account
2. Host it on github pages

## How to add your own URLs
Edit index.html inside github and edit like this:

{
  0: "default/fallback URL",
  
  ID : "URL",
  ID : "URL",
  ID : "URL",
  ...
}

Once you commit your changes, give it a few minutes and go to this URL:

# https://<replace with your username>.github.io/QRredirect/?id=<replace with ID>

This will instantly take you to the corisponding URL
